## General info
This is a very simple program that shows an animation of dots moving straight, but that seem to move on a circular motion.

## Technologies
For the animation I used:
* <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js library</a>

## Setup
* you can click on this <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Pole/present/F6Ic73t1b">link</a>.
* you can download the files in the repository and run the html in a local server. You can either use brackets, which is an IDE with the live server functionality built in or you can use VSCode with a live server extension.

## Explanation
The only things you can do are admire the animation and use the slider to change the number of dots in the animation.
